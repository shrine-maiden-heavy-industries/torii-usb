## [0.8.0] - 2025-06-26

This is a maintenance release, syncs the minimum [Torii] version to `0.8.0` in preparation for
the Torii `1.0.0` release in the future.

## Changed

- Bumped Torii minimum version from `0.7.7` to `0.8.0`

### Deprecated

- Preemptively deprecated `torii_usb.stream.generator` as the contents will be merged into the [Torii] `torii.lib.streams.simple` library in the near future.

### Removed

- Removed the `torii_usb.utils.io` module, as the only member `delay` was FPGA specific, and not used elsewhere within the codebase, it was moved over to [SOL], where it was the only known consumer.

## [0.7.1] - 2025-03-11

## Changed

- Bumped Torii minimum version from `0.7.6` to `0.7.7`

## [0.7.0] - 2025-03-07

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the first release after the split from [SOL], This is primarily a release to set things up
