        For instance if something is hard to understand or unclear, rather than just saying
        "X is incorrect", walk us through what you understood it to mean.


        If something **is** outright incorrect, simply describe where/what it was, and how badly
        incorrect it is. For example, if it's a minor issue such as a typo, or if it describing
        functionality that just outright doesn't exist or work the way it says.
