The LUNA library is a work in progress; but many of its features are usable enough for inclusion in your own designs.
More testing of our work -- and more feedback -- is always appreciated!

Support for Host Mode
-----------------------

The LUNA library currently does not provide any support for operating as a USB host; though the low-level USB
communications interfaces have been designed to allow for eventual host support. Host support is not currently
a priority, but contributions are welcome.


"Reference" Boards
------------------

The LUNA library is intended to work on any FPGA with sufficient fabric performand and resources; but testing is
only performed on a collection of reference boards.
