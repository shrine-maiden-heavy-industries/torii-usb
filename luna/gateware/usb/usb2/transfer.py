class USBInTransferManager(Elaboratable):
    """ Sequencer that converts a long data stream (a USB *transfer*) into a burst of USB packets.

    This module is designed so it can serve as the core of a IN endpoint.

    Attributes
    ----------

    active: Signal(), input
        Held high to enable this module to send packets to the host, and interpret tokens from the host.
        This is typically equivalent to the relevant endpoint being addressed by the host.

    transfer_stream: StreamInterface, input stream
        Input stream; accepts transfer data to be sent on the endpoint. This stream represents
        a USB transfer, and can be as long as is desired; and will be sent in max-packet-size chunks.

        For this stream: ``first`` is ignored; and thus entirely optional. ``last`` is optional;
        if it is not provided; this module will send only max-length-packets, sending a new packet
        every time a full packet size is reached.
    packet_stream: USBInStreamInterface, output stream
        Output stream; broken into packets to be sent.

    data_pid: Signal(2), output
        The LSBs of the data PID to be issued with the current packet. Used with :attr:`packet_stream`
        to indicate the PID of the transmitted packet.

    tokenizer: TokenDetectorInterface, input
        Connection to a detector that detects incoming tokens packets.

    handshakes_in: HandshakeExchangeInterface, input
        Indicates when handshakes are received from the host.
    handshakes_out: HandshakeExchangeInterface, output
        Output that carries handshake packet requests.

    generate_zlps: Signal(), input
        If high, zero-length packets will automatically be generated if the end of a transfer would
        not result in a short packet. (This should be set for control endpoints; and for any interface
        where transfer boundaries are significant.)

    start_with_data1: Signal(), input
        If high, the transmitter will start our PID with DATA1
    reset_sequence: Signal(), input
        If true, our PID generated will reset to the value indicated by `start_with_data1`.
        If desired, this can be held permanently high to control our PID expectation manually.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_packet_size: int
        The maximum packet size for our associated endpoint, in bytes.

        # 1) we must be able to transmit packets at a full rate; i.e.
        #    must be asserted from the start to the end of our transfer; and
        # 2) we must be able to re-transmit data if a given packet is not ACK'd.
        #
        # Accordingly, we'll buffer a full USB packet of data, and then transmit
        # it once either a) our buffer is full, or 2) the transfer ends (last=1).
        #
        # This implementation is double buffered; so a buffer fill can be pipelined
