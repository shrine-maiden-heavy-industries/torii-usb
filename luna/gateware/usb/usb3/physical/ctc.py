""" Code for handling SKP ordered sets on the transmit and receive path.

SKP ordered sets are provided in order to give some "padding data" that can be removed
in order to handle differences in transmitter/receiver clock rates -- a process called
"clock tolerance compensation" (CTC). The actual insertion and removal of SKP ordered sets
for CTC is handled by the PHY -- but it only adds and removes sets where it needs to to
compensate for clock differences.

It's up to us to insert and remove additional ordered sets.

class CTCSkipRemover(Elaboratable):
    """ Clock Tolerance Compensation (CTC) receive buffer gateware.

    It's functionally impossible to precisely synchronize the clocks for two independent
    systems -- every specification has to allow for some difference in frequency between
    the system's clocks (the "clock tolerance")

    To compensate, high speed serial protocols inject 'filler' bytes called "SKP ordered sets",
    which can be safely discarded. This allows the slower clock to catch up to the faster one.
    [USB 3.2r1: 6.4.3].

    Our PHY handles the core clock tolerance compesnation inside of its own clock domain; removing
    these filler sets whenever removing them helps to keep the receiver and transmitter's clocks in sync.
    This leaves behind the sets whose removal would not directly help with CTC.

    This module removes those leftovers before data leaves the physical layer.
